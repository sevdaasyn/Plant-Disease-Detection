## Plant-Disease-Detection

Plant disease detection using some machine learning techniques.
Various methods are available to determine if a plant
has a disease. One of these methods is to look at the leaves
of plants. Discoloration on the leaf, yellowing, fading,
desiccation, regional staining, the formation of intermediate
holes and such as these symptoms is a sign of disease.
Each plant type has its own specific diseases. For example;
black rot disease in apple, powdery mildew disease in
cherry, common rust disease in corn, leaf blight disease in
grapes, etc.

### Dataset

Dataset contains both healthy and diseased plant
leaf samples for each plant. There are usually 3 or 4
disease classes for each plant. In total, consists of 38
classes. There are 300 train images, 50 validation images
and 50 test images for each class. Our dataset plants:
tomato, squash, raspberry, potato, grape, strawberry, pepper,
peach, orange, corn, cherry, soybean, blueberry, apple.
